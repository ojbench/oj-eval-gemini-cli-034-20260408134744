## Introduction

### Background

Implement a skip list class template supporting insert, delete, search operations.

## Assignment Description

### Grade Composition

| Grading Component | Percentage |
| :--: | :--: |
| Pass **2110. 跳表** | 80% |
| Code Review | 20% |

Here are several points that need clarification:

- In the Code Review, we will **strictly examine your code style and repository organization structure, etc.**

- This assignment provides some sample data for testing, stored in the `/workspace/data/034/data_test/` directory. Note that these are not the test cases on the Online Judge. Passing all local test cases does not guarantee that you will pass the OJ tests.

- Besides the provided sample data, we also encourage you to design your own test data based on your program logic to assist debugging.

## Assignment Requirements

### Problem Description

请你实现一个跳表类，使用以下模板，并提交该 .hpp  文件至提交窗口。

跳表应该实现对某一数据结构T的变量进行增、删、查操作。T除了支持 `<` 操作符以外，你不能对它的性质有任何期望。

助教会手动检查你的代码，以确认你确实使用了跳表完成本题。

```
#ifndef SKIP_LIST_HPP
#define SKIP_LIST_HPP

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <climits>

template<typename T>
class SkipList {
private:
    //add whatever you want here

public:
    SkipList();

    ~SkipList();

    // Insert a value into the skip list. If the value already exists, do nothing.
    void insert(const T & item);

    // Search for a value in the skip list
    bool search(const T & item);

    // Delete a value from the skip list. If the value does not exist in the skip list, do nothing.
    void deleteItem(const T & item);
};

#endif
```

### Input Format

See the problem description above.

### Output Format

## Per-Testcase Resource Limits

- **Time Limit (per test case)**: 9000 ms
- **Memory Limit (per test case)**: 256 MiB
- **Disk Usage**: No disk usage is permitted.

## Test Data

The test data for this problem is located at `/workspace/data/034/data_test/`.

## Submission Requirements

### OJ Git Repository Compilation Process

For Git compilation, we will first clone the repository using a command similar to:
```bash
git clone <repo_url> . --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules --no-local
```

Then we check if there is a `CMakeLists.txt` file. If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
cmake .
```

Finally, we check if there is any of `GNUmakefile`/`makefile`/`Makefile` (if cmake was run previously, this will be the generated Makefile). If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
make
```

After this process is complete, we will use the `code` file in the project root directory as the compilation result.

A `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided in the project. You can use or modify it as needed. The local environment has gcc-13 and g++-13 available.

### Git Configuration Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory to avoid OJ evaluation conflicts.

The `.gitignore` file should include at least the following entries:

```gitignore
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
```

### Submission Guidelines

- The submitted code must be able to compile successfully through the above compilation process
- The compiled executable file name must be `code`
- The program needs to be able to read data from standard input and write results to standard output
- Please ensure the code runs correctly within the given time and space limits
- **You must use C++ or C language** to implement this assignment

### Evaluation Notes

- The evaluation system will test your program using the provided test data
- The program output must exactly match the expected output (including format)
- Exceeding time or memory limits will be judged as the corresponding error type
- Please pay attention to the overall time performance of your code and the time complexity of each part of your algorithm.

### Academic Integrity

If any violations are found during evaluation or code review (including but not limited to using unconventional methods to pass test cases), your final score may be significantly reduced or become **0 points**.
